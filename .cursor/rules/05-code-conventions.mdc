# Code Conventions

## File Organization

- **App Router Pattern** - Next.js App Router for file-based routing
  - Page components in `src/app/*/page.tsx`
  - Layout components in `src/app/*/layout.tsx`
  - Route handlers in `src/app/api/*/route.ts`

## Component Structure

- React functional components with TypeScript
- Props interfaces defined for each component
- React hooks for state management
- Context providers for shared state

## TypeScript Usage

- Strong typing for all components and functions
- Type definitions in [src/types](mdc:src/types)
- Interface declarations near component usage

## API Structure

- API endpoints follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Route handlers defined in `src/app/api/*/route.ts`
- HTTP methods (GET, POST) defined as separate exported functions
